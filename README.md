MCP23017
========

Controlling MPC/MPD with push buttons and a MCP23017 chip

This script is based in this Adafruit tutorial: http://learn.adafruit.com/mcp230xx-gpio-expander-on-the-raspberry-pi


Don't forget to download booth files (the Adafruit_I2C.py file is like a "driver" for the chip) and follow this tutorial to install the python and the I2C tools: http://www.skpang.co.uk/blog/archives/575  (The "Example" part is not necessary)
Before try to run the script REBOOT YOUR RASPBERRY PI! If you don't get the results expected during the tutorial, reboot the Raspberry Pi!
